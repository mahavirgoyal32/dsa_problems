### üìù Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3


Example 2:


Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## AI Generated Solution

The LeetCode problem "Valid Triangle Number" asks us to determine how many valid triangle triplets can be formed from a given array of integers. A valid triangle triplet is defined by three lengths \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) such that the following triangle inequality conditions hold:

1. \( a + b > c \)
2. \( a + c > b \)
3. \( b + c > a \)

When sorted, we can simplify these conditions to just one condition: for any three sides \( a \leq b \leq c \), the only condition we need to check is if \( a + b > c \).

### Problem Approach

1. **Sort the array**: Start by sorting the input array so that we can efficiently find valid triplets using the triangle condition.
2. **Use two pointers**: Iterate through each element in the sorted list and use a two-pointer approach to find pairs of elements that can form a triangle with the current element.
3. **Count valid triangles**: For each combination of the current element and the pairs found by the two pointers, check the triangle condition and count the valid ones.

### Implementation

Here is the C++ code that implements the above logic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int triangleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Step 2: Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
            int k = i + 2; // Pointer to the third element of the triplet
            // Step 3: Use two pointers
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                while (k < n && nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]) {
                    ++k; // Increment k while the condition is satisfied
                }
                // If we exit the while loop, it means nums[i] + nums[j] <= nums[k]
                // All indices from j+1 to k-1 are valid for the triangle condition
                count += (k - j - 1); // (k - j - 1) valid triangles with nums[i] and nums[j]
            }
        }
        return count; // Return the count of valid triangles
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 2, 3, 4};
    std::cout << "Number of valid triangles: " << solution.triangleNumber(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Sorting the array**: We first sort the `nums` array so that we can easily check the triangle condition.
2. **Iterate using index `i`**: We loop through each element, treating it as the smallest side of the triangle.
3. **Inner loop with index `j`**: For each `i`, we then loop through the remaining elements starting from `i+1`, treating them as the second side of the triangle.
4. **Finding valid third sides using pointer `k`**: We initialize a pointer `k` to `i + 2` (the next element after `j`). The inner while loop increments `k` as long as the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is greater than `nums[k]`. When the loop exits, `k` points to the first element that does not satisfy the triangle inequality, which means all indices from `j + 1` to `k - 1` are valid third sides.
5. **Counting valid triangles**: We add `(k - j - 1)` to our count for each valid pair \( (i, j) \), where we find the number of valid `k`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: The sorting step takes \( O(n \log n) \), and the nested loops take \( O(n^2) \), leading to an overall complexity of \( O(n^2) \).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for using a few extra variables aside from the input, since we sort the input in place.

This solution efficiently counts the number of valid triangle triplets by leveraging sorting and a two-pointer technique, making it both clever and performant for the problem at hand.
