### üìù Problem Description

Given two version strings, version1 and version2, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots &#39;.&#39;. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.

To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as 0.

Return the following:


	If version1 < version2, return -1.
	If version1 > version2, return 1.
	Otherwise, return 0.


 
Example 1:


Input: version1 = &quot;1.2&quot;, version2 = &quot;1.10&quot;

Output: -1

Explanation:

version1&#39;s second revision is &quot;2&quot; and version2&#39;s second revision is &quot;10&quot;: 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.


Example 2:


Input: version1 = &quot;1.01&quot;, version2 = &quot;1.001&quot;

Output: 0

Explanation:

Ignoring leading zeroes, both &quot;01&quot; and &quot;001&quot; represent the same integer &quot;1&quot;.


Example 3:


Input: version1 = &quot;1.0&quot;, version2 = &quot;1.0.0.0&quot;

Output: 0

Explanation:

version1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as &quot;0&quot;.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
	version1 and version2 only contain digits and &#39;.&#39;.
	version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
	All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.
