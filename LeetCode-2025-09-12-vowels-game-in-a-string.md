### üìù Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.

You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:


	On Alice&#39;s turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
	On Bob&#39;s turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.


The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.

The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;leetcoder&quot;

Output: true

Explanation:
Alice can win the game as follows:


	Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = &quot;leetcoder&quot; which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is s = &quot;der&quot;.
	Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = &quot;der&quot; which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is s = &quot;er&quot;.
	Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = &quot;er&quot; which contains 1 vowel.
	Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.



Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;bbcd&quot;

Output: false

Explanation:
There is no valid play for Alice in her first turn, so Alice loses the game.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.
