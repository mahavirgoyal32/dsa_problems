### 📝 Problem Description

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer k, determine whether there exist two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. Specifically, check if there are two subarrays starting at indices a and b (a < b), where:


	Both subarrays nums[a..a + k - 1] and nums[b..b + k - 1] are strictly increasing.
	The subarrays must be adjacent, meaning b = a + k.


Return true if it is possible to find two such subarrays, and false otherwise.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1], k = 3

Output: true

Explanation:


	The subarray starting at index 2 is [7, 8, 9], which is strictly increasing.
	The subarray starting at index 5 is [2, 3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
	These two subarrays are adjacent, so the result is true.



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7], k = 5

Output: false


 
Constraints:


	2 <= nums.length <= 100
	1 < 2 * k <= nums.length
	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## AI Generated Solution

Certainly! The problem "Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection I" requires us to determine if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in an array where the first element is strictly less than the second. If such a pair exists, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We need to iterate through the array and compare each element with the next one.
2. If we find any pair where the current element is less than the next one, we can immediately return `true`.
3. If we finish iterating through the array without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we are just making a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

### C++ Solution

Here’s how we can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasAdjacentIncreasingSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Edge case: if there are less than 2 elements, we cannot have adjacent pairs
        if (nums.size() < 2) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Iterating through the vector to check for adjacent increasing pairs
        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
                return true; // found a pair where a[i] < a[i + 1]
            }
        }
        
        return false; // no such pair found
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Edge Case Handling (Lines 5-7)**: 
   - We first check if the size of the given array `nums` is less than 2. If it is, we return `false` because there can't be any pairs of adjacent elements.

2. **Main Loop (Lines 9-13)**: 
   - We loop through the array from the start to the second last element using a for-loop (`for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i)`).
   - Inside the loop, we compare each element with the next one (`if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1])`).
   - If we find a pair where the current element is less than the next one, we return `true` immediately.

3. **Final Return (Line 15)**: 
   - If we finish the loop without returning `true`, it means no such adjacent increasing pairs were found, so we return `false`.

This function efficiently checks for adjacent increasing pairs in a single pass through the array.
