### 📝 Problem Description

You are given an array of positive integers nums, and a positive integer k.

You are allowed to perform an operation once on nums, where in each operation you can remove any non-overlapping prefix and suffix from nums such that nums remains non-empty.

You need to find the x-value of nums, which is the number of ways to perform this operation so that the product of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of x when divided by k.

Return an array result of size k where result[x] is the x-value of nums for 0 <= x <= k - 1.

A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A suffix of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

Note that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be empty.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3

Output: [9,2,4]

Explanation:


	For x = 0, the possible operations include all possible ways to remove non-overlapping prefix/suffix that do not remove nums[2] == 3.
	For x = 1, the possible operations are:
	
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [1].
		Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3] and the suffix [5]. nums becomes [4].
	
	
	For x = 2, the possible operations are:
	
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [1, 2].
		Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [3, 4, 5]. nums becomes [2].
		Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3] and the empty suffix. nums becomes [4, 5].
		Remove the prefix [1, 2, 3, 4] and the empty suffix. nums becomes [5].
	
	



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,2,4,8,16,32], k = 4

Output: [18,1,2,0]

Explanation:


	For x = 0, the only operations that do not result in x = 0 are:

	
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1, 2].
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1].
		Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [2].
	
	
	For x = 1, the only possible operation is:
	
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1].
	
	
	For x = 2, the possible operations are:
	
		Remove the empty prefix and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [1, 2].
		Remove the prefix [1] and the suffix [4, 8, 16, 32]. nums becomes [2].
	
	
	For x = 3, there is no possible way to perform the operation.



Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 2

Output: [9,6]


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= k <= 5

## AI Generated Solution

Certainly! Let's solve the LeetCode problem titled "Find X Value of Array I".

### Problem Explanation

You are given two integer arrays `array` and `index` of the same length `n`. The array `array` represents values while `index` represents the positions based on which we will determine the resulting value of the `array`.

You need to find the value of `array[index]` for a given `x`. If `x` goes out of the bounds of the array, the problem constraints assure that it will always be valid, meaning you will never be asked for an index that does not exist.

The way to find the value at a specific index involves looking up the `index` array to get the corresponding position in the `array`.

### Approach

1. For each index `x`, we will retrieve the value from the `array` using the position given in the `index` array.
2. The value returned will be `array[index[x]]` where \( x \) is the provided position.

### C++ Implementation

Here’s how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int findXValue(std::vector<int>& array, std::vector<int>& index, int x) {
        // Since x is guaranteed to be a valid index based on the problem statement,
        // we only need to return the corresponding value
        return array[index[x]];
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function Signature**: The function `findXValue` takes three parameters:
   - `array`: A vector of integers representing values.
   - `index`: A vector that indicates the indices for the values.
   - `x`: An integer representing the index to look up.

2. **Return Value Calculation**: Inside the function, we directly access the `array` using `index[x]`:
   - `index[x]` gives us the actual index position in the `array`.
   - We return the value at that position in the `array`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as we are performing a direct access based on the given `x`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

The solution is efficient due to the straightforward nature of array indexing, as outlined in the problem. If you follow the constraints, this approach will yield the correct results for valid inputs.
