### 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer array target. You have an integer array initial of the same size as target with all elements initially zeros.

In one operation you can choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 
Example 1:


Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the initial array.
[0,0,0,0,0] increment 1 from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
[1,1,1,1,1] increment 1 from index 1 to 3 (inclusive).
[1,2,2,2,1] increment 1 at index 2.
[1,2,3,2,1] target array is formed.


Example 2:


Input: target = [3,1,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: [0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1] -> [1,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] -> [3,1,1,2]


Example 3:


Input: target = [3,1,5,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: [0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1] -> [2,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,2,2,2] -> [3,1,3,3,2] -> [3,1,4,4,2] -> [3,1,5,4,2].


 
Constraints:


	1 <= target.length <= 105
	1 <= target[i] <= 105

## AI Generated Solution

To tackle the LeetCode problem "Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array," we need to understand the task clearly. We're trying to transform an array `A` into a target array `target` by performing a series of operations that involve incrementing subarrays. The goal is to minimize the number of increments we perform.

### Problem Understanding

Given two arrays:
- `A` (the original array)
- `target` (the target array we want to achieve)

You can pick any contiguous subarray from `A` and increment all of its elements by 1. The task is to determine the minimum number of such increments needed to make `A ` equal to `target`.

### Key Observations

1. **Increment Counting**: To change an element `A[i]` to `target[i]`, we need to increment `A[i]` a total of `target[i] - A[i]` times if `target[i] > A[i]`.
2. **Adjacent Changes**: When elements change from `A[i]` to `target[i]`, we need to consider changes in contiguous segments. That means if you're incrementing `A[i]` to match `target[i]`, the increment operation should also extend to neighboring elements that have not yet reached their target.

### Solution Plan

1. **Traverse through both arrays** (`A` and `target`):
   - Calculate the required increment for each index: `delta[i] = target[i] - A[i]`.
   - We only need to focus on positive increments where `delta[i] > 0`.
2. **Count Increment Sections**:
   - Count the number of contiguous sections where `delta[i]` is greater than the previous element. This defines separate increment operations.

### Implementation in C++

Here is the C++ solution to implement the above logic:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minIncrements(std::vector<int>& A, std::vector<int>& target) {
        int n = A.size();
        int increments = 0; // Total increments needed
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Calculate the increment needed to make A[i] equal to target[i]
            int increment_needed = target[i] - A[i];
            if (increment_needed > 0) {
                // If this is the first increment
                if (i == 0 || (target[i - 1] - A[i - 1]) <= 0) {
                    increments += increment_needed; // Start new increments
                } else {
                    // If we are in a contiguous increment zone, we need to make sure
                    // we count overall differences rather than overlapping too much.
                    increments += (increment_needed + A[i] - target[i - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return increments;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> A = {1, 2, 3};
    std::vector<int> target = {2, 3, 4};

    std::cout << "Minimum increments needed: " << solution.minIncrements(A, target) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `minIncrements` that takes two vectors, `A` and `target`.
- The total number of increments (`increments`) is initialized to zero.
- We loop through the array:
  - Calculate how many increments are needed for each corresponding index in `A` compared to `target`.
  - If the increments needed are greater than zero, we check if it's a new contiguous increment (first element or previous target is not achieved).
  - We update the total increments needed based on the current increment requirement.
- The final result is returned.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the arrays, since we are iterating through the arrays once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), aside from the inputs since we are using a constant amount of additional space. 

This solution ensures that we count all necessary increments efficiently while respecting the rules of maximum contiguity in our operations on the `A` array.
