  "content": "<p>You have two soups, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, each starting with <code>n</code> mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen <em>at random</em>, each with probability <code>0.25</code> <strong>independent</strong> of all previous turns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B</li>\n\t<li>pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.</li>\n\t<li>The amounts from A and B are poured <em>simultaneously</em> during the turn.</li>\n\t<li>If an operation asks you to pour <strong>more than</strong> you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The process stops immediately after any turn in which <em>one of the soups</em> is used up.</p>\n\n<p>Return the probability that A is used up <em>before</em> B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the<strong> same turn</strong>. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 50\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0.62500\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nIf we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.\nIf we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.\nIf we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.\nSo the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 100\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0.71875\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nIf we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.\nIf we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.\nIf we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.\nIf we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.\nSo the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n"
