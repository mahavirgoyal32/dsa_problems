### üìù Problem Description

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

 
Example 1:


Input: text = &quot;hello world&quot;, brokenLetters = &quot;ad&quot;
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type &quot;world&quot; because the &#39;d&#39; key is broken.


Example 2:


Input: text = &quot;leet code&quot;, brokenLetters = &quot;lt&quot;
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type &quot;leet&quot; because the &#39;l&#39; and &#39;t&#39; keys are broken.


Example 3:


Input: text = &quot;leet code&quot;, brokenLetters = &quot;e&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the &#39;e&#39; key is broken.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= text.length <= 104
	0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26
	text consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
	Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
	brokenLetters consists of distinct lowercase English letters.
