### üìù Problem Description

You are given a string num representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:


	It is a substring of num with length 3.
	It consists of only one unique digit.


Return the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string &quot;&quot; if no such integer exists.

Note:


	A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
	There may be leading zeroes in num or a good integer.


 
Example 1:


Input: num = &quot;6777133339&quot;
Output: &quot;777&quot;
Explanation: There are two distinct good integers: &quot;777&quot; and &quot;333&quot;.
&quot;777&quot; is the largest, so we return &quot;777&quot;.


Example 2:


Input: num = &quot;2300019&quot;
Output: &quot;000&quot;
Explanation: &quot;000&quot; is the only good integer.


Example 3:


Input: num = &quot;42352338&quot;
Output: &quot;&quot;
Explanation: No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.


 
Constraints:


	3 <= num.length <= 1000
	num only consists of digits.
